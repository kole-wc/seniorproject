# Assumption University Senior Project

 We were tasked to develop an application that is able to solve a company's business problems or enhance its operations.
 We observed and analyzed the business practices then later defined problems and created objectives.
 
 The company experience legacy problems. It is an old business that is still storing paper-based information to this date. This made some of their processes very slow and inefficient, including problems regarding information redundancy.
 
 Therefore, we offered to develop an application that allows the company to store and retrieve information with CRUD operations.
 
 We are challenged with various tasks including system analysis and designs which include dataflow diagram, entity-relationship diagram, and more.
